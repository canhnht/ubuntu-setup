[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imumesh18/dev-setup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dungeonmaster18/dev-setup)

### Introduction

It's a simple one command linux development setup. It uses bash script and makefile to automate the instllation.

### Supported Platforms

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS(Tested)
- Ubuntu 17.10 LTS(Tested)

- It should also work on debian based other distros as well.

### Installation

Installation is pretty much easy. You just need to select which app you want to install and see the following for a perticular installation command.

> I would suggest always install the base script first for other scripts to work properly.

### Testing

- It uses [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to test the scripts. It can be done in two ways

  - Using Docker<br>
    `make test`
  - Using Shellcheck Binary<br>
    `./test.sh`

- Test the script by running on your machine and see if it gets installed correctly.

### Formatting

Though this step is not mandatory but I do encourage people to format their shell scripts. It uses [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) to format the scripts. To format your script just run.<br>

`make format`

> It uses [Google's Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml) guide to format the script.

### Motivation

> TODO: Put the motivation in more sane words.

So the story behind this repo is quite amazing. So I being a lazy ass and a linux nerd(I experiment a lot with my machines) which most of the time(almost all time ) used to break something and when I try fixing that I end up make a complete mesh of my machine so I have to use the ultimate weapon of every developer that is clean install my machine. I know that sucks because you have to setup everything from scratch. So I kind of thought why don't I have something to automate all this bullshit donkey work by just running simple command. I evaluated few of the options like vagrant and docker but I kind of use docker to run almost evrything but then too I needed do few of the basic setup. Vagrant is vmbox underneath which makes it heavy as I don't have a ultimate beast machine yet. Also I have come across the Boxen but that is too much for setting up personal machine because it uses puppet which not too easy to setup, I don't wanted to go down the puppet rabbit hole.
So I thought let's go bash way.
